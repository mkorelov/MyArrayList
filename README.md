# MyArrayList
This is my implementaion of java's ArrayList. I implemented a majority of the methods following the descriptions provided at: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html. MyArrayList makes use of generics, to limit an instance to one Object type. The full list of methods implemented can be seen below and descriptions of each can be found in the MyArrayList.java file.

1) Write sanity tests for basic methods. (Done)
2) Implement insert(idx, elem), contains(elem), delete(idx), get(idx), size() & getCapacity(). (Done)
3) Write advanced tests w/ edge cases. (Done)
4) Write sanity tests for advanced methods. (Done)
5) Implement trimToSize(), toArray(), set(idx, elem), remove(elem), lastIndexOf(elem), isEmpty(), indexOf(elem), ensureCapacity(sz), clone(), clear(), addAll(arr), & add(elem). (Done)
6) Implement the constructor given an array. (Done)
7) Write advanced tests w/ edge cases. (Done)

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
